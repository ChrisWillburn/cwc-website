          <p>I was depressed, anxious, struggling with insomnia, on a ton of different prescription medications, and DEEPLY unhappy. </p>

          <p>I had gained a bunch of weight slowly after a downward spiral when my dad died several years earlier. I also had developed some really <b>unhealthy habits</b> to cope with my grief and sadness.</p>

          <p>All I wanted in the world was to <b>lose that weight</b> and get back to "myself" because I knew it would make me happy.</p>

          <p>So over the course of about a year I lost weight - almost 100 pounds. (I would eventually lose the whole 100 plus).</p>
          </div>
          </div>

          <p><b>Except I wasn't happy.</b></p>

          <p>Intrinsically, <b>I knew I wasn't going to find happiness in something external</b> like weight loss, even though that was part of the puzzle.</p>

          <p>So I went on a journey to learn how to be happy. I learned how to control stress, to stop being so negative and stop beating myself up all the time.</p>

          <p>I learned the <b>benefits of positivity</b> and simple steps to start using it.</p>

          <p className="about-centered">I learned happiness was a choice<br></br>and I chose it every day.</p>

          <p>During that journey I decided I wanted to help others lose weight too.</p>

          <p>So by early 2014 I had obtained the necessary requirements/certifications to start working with clients. </p>

          <p>I quickly realized my clients were all struggling with the same things I struggled with when I was super overweight and unhappy.</p>

          <p>The things they don't teach in the classes, courses, and certifications.</p>

          <p>So along with my simple, <b>no nonsense approach to nutrition</b>, I eventually created a system of mental, emotional, and physical health that incorporated everything I've learned in over a decade of work.</p>

          <hr />

          <p>What became my true passion was helping people change their relationship with themselves - to put themselves first and to <b>practice self love</b> every day.</p>

          <p>That is what I've found produces not only weight loss, but <b>radical transformation</b> - so much more than just weight loss. I believe it's the answer to weight loss...forever.</p>

          <p>And that's my origin story.</p>
